### Installation

- Install globally using npm: `npm install -g tracelogg`

### Configuration

Copy the following example config file to `~/.tracelogg/config` and change values as necessary:

```javascript
var config = {};

//DEFINE THE SERVER PORT
config.port = 9000;

//DEFINE THE DIRECTORY WHERE LOGS ARE LOCATED
config.logDirectory = '/log';

/*******************************************
******** ADVANCED CONFIGURATION ***********
*******************************************/

//DEFINE PORT MAPPINGS FOR EACH APP YOU WISH TO INSPECT
config.portAppMap = {
    9229: 'main-api.log'
    9230: 'midware-api.log'
}

//DEFINE LOGS STREAMS THAT ARE UI APPS, THESE WILL AUTOMATICALLY REFRESH WHEN YOUR BUILD PROCESS COMPLETES
config.uiLogStreams = ['admin-ui.log', 'web-ui.log'];

//DEFINE PARTIAL STRING THAT INDICATES UI BUILD STARTING
config.uiBuildStartString = 'Now building webpack bundle for environment: dev';

//DEFINE PARTIAL STRING THAT INDICATES UI BUILD COMPLETE
config.uiBuildStopString = 'Finished build after';

module.exports = config;
```
